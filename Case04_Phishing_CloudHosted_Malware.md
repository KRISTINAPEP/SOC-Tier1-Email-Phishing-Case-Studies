CASE 04
Cloud Hosted Malware Delivery via Trusted Service

Summary
This investigation analyzes a malicious call to action element extracted from a phishing email using browser based DOM inspection. The embedded hyperlink directed the user to download a Windows Installer file disguised as an electronic statement. The payload was hosted on a trusted Google cloud storage service to bypass email security controls and exploit user trust.

Investigation Method
1. Artifact based investigation of the embedded hyperlink and associated file type
2. DOM level analysis using browser developer tools to reveal the true destination
3. Direct inspection of the call to action element within the email body
4. Static review of the payload hosting location and executable format

Key Definitions
DOM Document Object Model
The structural representation of a webpage or HTML email. DOM inspection exposes hidden attributes and true link destinations that differ from visible text.

Call to Action CTA
A button or link designed to prompt user interaction such as downloading a file or accessing an account.

MSI File
A Windows Installer package capable of executing code and installing software. MSI files are executable and not static documents like PDFs.

Cloud Service Abuse
The use of legitimate cloud platforms such as Google Firebase to host malicious payloads in order to evade filtering and increase credibility.

Observed Artifacts
1. Element type HTML anchor tag
2. Visible text Download Your Statement Support Client
3. File type Windows Installer package
4. File extension msi
5. Hosting domain firebasestorage.googleapis.com
6. Delivery method direct download from cloud storage

Threat Analysis
The attacker used financial themed language to socially engineer the user into downloading an executable file disguised as a legitimate statement. Hosting the payload on Firebase Storage leverages a trusted Google owned domain which increases the likelihood of bypassing reputation based filtering. MSI payloads delivered through phishing emails represent a high risk vector and are commonly associated with malware loaders credential theft and remote access tools.

Attack Technique
1. Social engineering using financial themed messaging
2. Masquerading an executable file as a document
3. Abuse of trusted cloud infrastructure
4. One click malware delivery through a call to action button

Threat Classification
Malware delivery via phishing using trusted cloud service abuse

Risk Assessment
1. High risk to the end user system
2. Potential for credential theft ransomware or secondary payload execution
3. Likely to bypass basic email and web filtering due to trusted cloud hosting
4. Immediate execution risk if the user downloads and runs the file

Recommended Response
1. Block the Firebase hosting URL and associated cloud object
2. Quarantine emails containing links to executable file types
3. Notify the user and advise against downloading or executing the file
4. Reset credentials and initiate endpoint scanning if execution is suspected
5. Escalate to endpoint security for further investigation

SOC Relevance
This case demonstrates practical Tier 1 investigation skills including artifact based analysis DOM inspection and identification of cloud hosted malware delivery techniques. It reflects real world SOC triage scenarios where analysts must assess malicious intent using partial evidence without reliance on full email headers.
