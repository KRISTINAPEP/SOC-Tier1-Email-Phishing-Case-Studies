# SOC Tier 1 Incident Investigation Case Studies

This repository contains a collection of SOC Tier 1 case studies conducted in a personal analysis environment simulating real Tier 1 SOC workflows. These investigations are documented to demonstrate analyst decision making, threat classification, and incident response skills used in entry level SOC roles.

Cases reflect realistic Tier 1 responsibilities across security monitoring, alert triage, phishing investigation, artifact analysis, and structured incident documentation.

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical analytical skills including:

- Log and artifact review
- Phishing detection and threat classification
- Email header and authentication analysis
- Link and redirect chain inspection
- Escalation decision making
- Clear, concise SOC style reporting
