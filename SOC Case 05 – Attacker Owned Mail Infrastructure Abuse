SOC Case 05-Attacker Owned Mail Infrastructure Abuse
====================================================

This case documents a phishing email sent from a fully attacker owned mail environment.
The attacker operated their own domain, mail server, and webmail interface, allowing
the message to pass SPF and DMARC checks while remaining malicious.

This is infrastructure abuse, not spoofing.

evidence/sanitized_notes.md
--------------------------------------------------

The email originated from bahamamail.com using attacker owned infrastructure.
SPF passed due to attacker controlled DNS configuration.
DKIM was not configured.
DMARC was present but set to p=NONE.
Internal headers show Roundcube Webmail and Postfix operating on the same VPS.
The Reply-To domain matches a previously analyzed malicious domain, indicating
threat actor reuse.

--------------------------------------------------
analysis/header_breakdown.md
--------------------------------------------------

The message entered Yahoo via HTTP submission, consistent with Roundcube Webmail usage.
The originating IP address 136.144.201.97 appears in both the X-Originating-IP header
and the SMTP handshake.
SPF passed because the attacker controls the domain’s DNS records.
DKIM was not configured, resulting in dkim=unknown.
DMARC passed due to a non-enforcing policy (p=NONE).
Internal headers show authenticated local user ID 1002 sending mail through Postfix
on localhost, confirming authenticated submission rather than spoofing.

--------------------------------------------------
analysis/infrastructure_mapping.md
--------------------------------------------------

Domain:
- bahamamail.com

Sending IP:
- 136.144.201.97

Mail Server Software:
- Postfix

Webmail Client:
- Roundcube Webmail

Security Tools:
- SpamAssassin
- ClamAV

Hosting:
- VPS with SMTP capability

Internal Mail User:
- User ID 1002

Secondary Infrastructure:
- Reply-To domain: nicolehassebrock.net

Assessment:
The attacker operates a complete mail environment, allowing authenticated email
submission that successfully passes SPF and DMARC checks despite being malicious.

--------------------------------------------------
analysis/authentication_deep_dive.md
--------------------------------------------------

SPF:
- PASS
- The attacker authorized the sending IP via DNS.

DKIM:
- UNKNOWN
- No DKIM signing configured for the domain.

DMARC:
- PASS (p=NONE)
- Policy exists but provides no enforcement.

Key Insight:
A DMARC pass with p=NONE provides no protection. When the attacker controls SPF,
email can be delivered successfully without DKIM signing.

--------------------------------------------------
summary/executive_summary.md
--------------------------------------------------

A phishing email was sent from bahamamail.com, a domain fully controlled by the attacker.
The attacker authenticated to their own Postfix server using Roundcube Webmail.
SPF passed due to attacker controlled DNS records.
DKIM was not configured.
DMARC existed but was set to p=NONE, allowing delivery without enforcement.
The Reply-To domain matches a previously identified malicious domain, confirming
threat actor reuse across campaigns.

--------------------------------------------------
summary/soc_workflow.md
--------------------------------------------------

- Received alert for suspicious inbound email
- Extracted and reviewed full email headers
- Identified sending IP address 136.144.201.97
- Performed reverse DNS and confirmed bahamamail.com
- Analyzed authentication results in context
- Identified Roundcube Webmail usage indicating manual sending
- Compared From and Reply-To domains
- Correlated Reply-To domain with a prior malicious case
- Classified activity as attacker owned infrastructure abuse
- Recommended blocking actions and documented findings

--------------------------------------------------
Final Assessment
--------------------------------------------------

This case demonstrates:
- Identification of attacker owned mail infrastructure
- Analysis of internal SMTP hops
- Understanding of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC limitations
- Threat actor correlation through Reply-To reuse
- Clear SOC Tier 1 documentation and classification

This is not a basic phishing case. This is infrastructure abuse analysis.
